## 💡 My Recommendation

**Do BOTH:**

### Today (Right Now):
1. Share website URL
2. iOS friends can test immediately

### After Xcode Installs:
1. Build IPA file
2. Share via AltStore
3. Friends get native app

## Key Differences

### Website (Just URL):

```

### AltStore IPA (Native App):

They: Download AltStore, install IPA
Works: 100% of features, 7-day refresh
```
